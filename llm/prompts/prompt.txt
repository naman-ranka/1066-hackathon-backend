Store Information:

Title (previously "Store Name")
Store Address (if available)
Date(only date) - YYYY-MM-D
List of Items:

For each item on the bill, extract the following:

"update the prompt where the LLM can identify the tax is not applied so the subtotal of the bill is the original total"
Item Name
Quantity (for display/informational purposes only; no calculations should use this quantity)
Total Price (the complete, final line-item cost as shown on the bill; do not calculate quantity * pricePerUnit)
Item Type
Food items → classify as Produce, Dairy, Meat, Grains, Snacks, or Beverages
Non-food items → classify as Electronics, Cosmetics, Appliances, or Other Packaged Goods
If Tax Rate Applied in the bill
1.8% for Food Items
8.1% for Non-Food Items
Else 
	Calculate the bill without the TAX. (do it intutively)
Tax Amount
calculated as Tax Rate × Total Price
Extra Charges
the share of additional fees (service/delivery/etc.) distributed evenly (if present)
Final Item Total
calculated as Total Price + Tax Amount + Extra Charges
Step 2: Handling Tax Distribution

Determine the applicable tax policy:
Single Tax Rate for the entire bill → distribute proportionally per item based on cost
Multiple Tax Rates → assign 1.8% to food items and 8.1% to non-food items
Verify that the correct tax rate is assigned to each item.
Compute the total tax by summing all individual item tax amounts.
Step 3: Handling Extra Charges

If additional charges (like service/delivery fees) appear, distribute them evenly across all items.
Update each item’s final total by adding its share of the extra charges.  Also if there is not taxes in the bill. Exempt it and calculate with the given information also what you can in formula(multiply by One % so that it does not change the subtotal)

{
  "storeInformation": {
    "title": "",
    "storeAddress": "",
    "dateTimeOfPurchase": ""  // in YYYY-MM-DD format
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "quantity": 0,
      "totalPrice": 0.0,
      "itemType": "",
      "tax": 0.0,  //in percent
      "taxAmount": 0.0,
      "itemTotalAfterTax": 0.0
    }
    // ... more items ...
  ],
  "subtotalBeforeChargesAndTaxes": 0.0,
  "totalExtraChargesDistributed": 0.0,

  "grandTotal": 0.0,
  "paymentDetails": {
    "paymentMethod": "" // e.g., Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card, etc.
  }
}

Step 5: Verification Process
subtotal = ...   # The pre-tax total
tax       = ...  # The total tax amount you have found (could be calculated or provided)

calculated_total = subtotal + tax

# Condition A: If (subtotal + tax) == subtotal
#    -> This effectively means there is no tax (tax = 0).
#       So final price is just the subtotal.
#
# Condition B: Otherwise, if the sum does not match the subtotal,
#    -> Then your calculated total is correct, so final price = subtotal + tax.
#     show that correct TAX that is applied
#
# Condition C: If none of these apply or there's some extra logic, 
#    -> Do the normal calculation (i.e., sum them up).
#

if calculated_total == subtotal:
    final_price = subtotal
else:
    final_price = calculated_total






Subtotal Check:
Ensure the subtotal equals the sum of all item total prices before applying taxes and extra charges.
New Bullet: After extracting all items from the bill or OCR, manually sum all the item totals. Compare this manually calculated subtotal with the subtotal shown on the bill. If they match, indicate "bill matched"; if not, use the manually computed total as the bill total.
Tax Calculation Verification:
Confirm that the correct tax rate (1.8% for Food Items, 8.1% for Non-Food Items) has been applied.
Compute and verify the total tax:
Total Tax = Sum of all individual item tax amounts.
Extra Charges Distribution:
Confirm that any extra charges are evenly distributed across all items and correctly added.
Final Grand Total Check:
Ensure the final grand total equals:
Grand Total = Subtotal + Total Extra Charges + Total Tax

No Tax applied:if there are not tax in bill, just try to match the sub total and sum of all the items
