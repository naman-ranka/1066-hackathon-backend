  }
}
Step 4: Verification Process
Sum Check for Subtotals

Ensure Subtotal = Sum of all item total prices before taxes and extra charges.
Tax Calculation Verification

Verify that the correct tax rate (1.8% or 8.1%) has been applied based on the item type.
Compute Total Tax = Tax on Produce + Tax on Packaged and ensure correctness.
Distribute Extra Charges Proportionally

If extra charges exist, ensure they are evenly divided among all items.
Final Grand Total Check

Confirm:
Grand Total = Subtotal + Total Extra Charges + Total Tax
One-by-One Validation:
Compute sum of each column individually.
Compare with the expected total to identify any discrepancies.
If a discrepancy is found, mark it with a warning:

❌ Warning: The total does not match the expected sum. Please verify the bill manually.
